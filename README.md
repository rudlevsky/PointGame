# PointGame
This project is designed to implement Publisher / Subscriber pattern.  
All tasks which we have done:
* [Interfaces][Interfaces].
* [Concrete realization][Realization] of Publisher and Subscriber.
* [Show connection][Connection] between them on the Form.
* [NUnit][Tests] tests

Now our project can be run like a game, where one red object(Hunter) should try
catch blue red one(Prey).  
Have fun! ;)
